## Core Concepts

**Vocabulary**: Terminal = VS Code terminal running Claude. Session = JSONL conversation file. Agent = webview character bound 1:1 to a terminal.

**Extension ↔ Webview**: `postMessage` protocol. Key messages: `openClaude`, `agentCreated/Closed`, `focusAgent`, `agentToolStart/Done/Clear`, `agentStatus`, `existingAgents`, `layoutLoaded`, `furnitureAssetsLoaded`, `floorTilesLoaded`, `wallTilesLoaded`, `saveLayout`, `saveAgentSeats`.

**One-agent-per-terminal**: Each "+ Agent" click → new terminal (`claude --session-id <uuid>`) → immediate agent creation → 1s poll for `<uuid>.jsonl` → file watching starts.

**Terminal adoption**: Project-level 1s scan detects unknown JSONL files. If active terminal has no agent → adopt. If focused agent exists → reassign (`/clear` handling).

## Agent Status Tracking

JSONL transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/<session-id>.jsonl`. Project hash = workspace path with `:`/`\`/`/` → `-`.

**JSONL record types**: `assistant` (tool_use blocks or thinking), `user` (tool_result or text prompt), `system` with `subtype: "turn_duration"` (reliable turn-end signal), `progress` (sub-agent activity — tool_use/tool_result forwarded to webview, non-exempt tools trigger permission timers).

**File watching**: Hybrid `fs.watch` + 2s polling backup. Partial line buffering for mid-write reads. Tool done messages delayed 300ms to prevent flicker.

**Extension state per agent**: `id, terminalRef, projectDir, jsonlFile, fileOffset, lineBuffer, activeToolIds, activeToolStatuses, activeSubagentToolNames, isWaiting`.

**Persistence**: Agents persisted to `workspaceState` key `'arcadia.agents'` (includes palette/hueShift/seatId). Layout to `'arcadia.layout'`. On webview ready: `restoreAgents()` matches persisted entries to live terminals. `nextAgentId`/`nextTerminalIndex` advanced past restored values.

## Office UI

**Rendering**: Game state in imperative `OfficeState` class (not React state). Pixel-perfect: zoom = integer device-pixels-per-sprite-pixel (1x–10x). No `ctx.scale(dpr)`. Default zoom = `Math.round(2 * devicePixelRatio)`. Z-sort all entities by Y. Pan via middle-mouse drag (`panRef`). **Camera follow**: `cameraFollowId` (separate from `selectedAgentId`) smoothly centers camera on the followed agent; set on agent click, cleared on deselection or manual pan.

**UI styling**: Pixel art aesthetic — all overlays use sharp corners (`borderRadius: 0`), solid backgrounds (`#1e1e2e`), `2px solid` borders, hard offset shadows (`2px 2px 0px #0a0a14`, no blur). CSS variables defined in `index.css` `:root` (`--pixel-bg`, `--pixel-border`, `--pixel-accent`, etc.). Pixel font: FS Pixel Sans (`webview-ui/src/fonts/`), loaded via `@font-face` in `index.css`, applied globally.

**Characters**: FSM states — active (pathfind to seat, typing/reading animation by tool type), idle (static standing pose, wander randomly with BFS). 4-directional sprites, left = flipped right. Tool animations: typing (Write/Edit/Bash/Task) vs reading (Read/Grep/Glob/WebFetch). Sitting offset: characters shift down 6px when in TYPE state so they visually sit in their chair. Z-sort uses `ch.y + TILE_SIZE/2 + 0.5` so characters render in front of same-row furniture (chairs) but behind furniture at lower rows (desks, bookshelves). Chair z-sorting: non-back chairs use `zY = (row+1)*TILE_SIZE` (capped to first row) so characters at any seat tile render in front; back-facing chairs use `zY = (row+1)*TILE_SIZE + 1` so the chair back renders in front of the character. Chair tiles are blocked for all characters except their own assigned seat (per-character pathfinding via `withOwnSeatUnblocked`). **Diverse palette assignment**: `pickDiversePalette()` counts palettes of current non-sub-agent characters; picks randomly from least-used palette(s). First 6 agents each get a unique skin; beyond 6, skins repeat with a random hue shift (45–315°) via `adjustSprite()`. Character stores `palette` (0-5) + `hueShift` (degrees). Sprite cache keyed by `"palette:hueShift"`.

**Spawn/despawn effect**: Matrix-style digital rain animation (0.3s). 16 vertical columns sweep top-to-bottom with staggered timing (per-column random seeds). Spawn: green rain reveals character pixels behind the sweep. Despawn: character pixels consumed by green rain trails. `matrixEffect` field on Character (`'spawn'`/`'despawn'`/`null`). Normal FSM is paused during effect. Despawning characters skip hit-testing. Restored agents (`existingAgents`) use `skipSpawnEffect: true` to appear instantly. `matrixEffect.ts` contains `renderMatrixEffect()` (per-pixel rendering) called from renderer instead of cached sprite draw.

**Sub-agents**: Negative IDs (from -1 down). Created on `agentToolStart` with "Subtask:" prefix. Same palette + hueShift as parent. Click focuses parent terminal. Not persisted. Spawn at closest free seat to parent (Manhattan distance); fallback: closest walkable tile. **Sub-agent permission detection**: when a sub-agent runs a non-exempt tool, `startPermissionTimer` fires on the parent agent; if 5s elapse with no data, permission bubbles appear on both parent and sub-agent characters. `activeSubagentToolNames` (parentToolId → subToolId → toolName) tracks which sub-tools are active for the exempt check. Cleared when data resumes or Task completes.

**Speech bubbles**: Permission ("..." amber dots) stays until clicked/cleared. Waiting (green checkmark) auto-fades 2s. Sprites in `spriteData.ts`.

**Seats**: Derived from chair furniture. `layoutToSeats()` creates a seat at every footprint tile of every chair. Multi-tile chairs (e.g. 2-tile couches) produce multiple seats keyed `uid` / `uid:1` / `uid:2`. Facing direction priority: 1) chair `orientation` from catalog (front→DOWN, back→UP, left→LEFT, right→RIGHT), 2) adjacent desk direction, 3) forward (DOWN). Click character → select (white outline) → click available seat → reassign.

## Layout Editor

Toggle via "Layout" button. Tools: SELECT (default), Floor paint, Wall paint, Erase (set tiles to VOID), Furniture place, Furniture pick (eyedropper for furniture type), Eyedropper (floor).

**Floor**: 7 patterns from `floors.png` (grayscale 16×16), colorizable via HSBC sliders (Photoshop Colorize). Color baked per-tile on paint. Eyedropper picks pattern+color.

**Walls**: Separate Wall paint tool. Click/drag to add walls; click/drag existing walls to remove (toggle direction set by first tile of drag, tracked by `wallDragAdding`). HSBC color sliders (Colorize mode) apply to all wall tiles at once. Eyedropper on a wall tile picks its color and switches to Wall tool. Furniture cannot be placed on wall tiles, but background rows (top N `backgroundTiles` rows) may overlap walls.

**Furniture**: Ghost preview (green/red validity). R key rotates, T key toggles on/off state. Drag-to-move in SELECT. Delete button (red X) + rotate button (blue arrow) on selected items. Any selected furniture shows HSBC color sliders (Color toggle + Clear button); color stored per-item in `PlacedFurniture.color?`. Single undo entry per color-editing session (tracked by `colorEditUidRef`). Pick tool copies type+color from placed item. Surface items preferred when clicking stacked furniture.

**Undo/Redo**: 50-level, Ctrl+Z/Y. EditActionBar (top-center when dirty): Undo, Redo, Save, Reset.

**Multi-stage Esc**: exit furniture pick → deselect catalog → close tool tab → deselect furniture → close editor.

**Erase tool**: Sets tiles to `TileType.VOID` (transparent, non-walkable, no furniture). Right-click in floor/wall/erase tools also erases to VOID (supports drag-erasing). Context menu suppressed in edit mode.

**Grid expansion**: In floor/wall/erase tools, a ghost border (dashed outline) appears 1 tile outside the grid. Clicking a ghost tile calls `expandLayout()` to grow the grid by 1 tile in that direction (left/right/up/down). New tiles are VOID. Furniture positions and character positions shift when expanding left/up. Max grid size: `MAX_COLS`×`MAX_ROWS` (64×64). Default: `DEFAULT_COLS`×`DEFAULT_ROWS` (20×11). Characters outside bounds after resize are relocated to random walkable tiles.

**Layout model**: `{ version: 1, cols, rows, tiles: TileType[], furniture: PlacedFurniture[], tileColors?: FloorColor[] }`. Grid dimensions are dynamic (not fixed constants). Persisted via debounced saveLayout message.

## Asset System

**Loading**: `esbuild.js` copies `webview-ui/public/assets/` → `dist/assets/`. Loader checks bundled path first, falls back to workspace root. PNG → pngjs → SpriteData (2D hex array, alpha≥128 = opaque).

**Catalog**: `furniture-catalog.json` with id, name, label, category, footprint, isDesk, canPlaceOnWalls, groupId?, orientation?, state?, canPlaceOnSurfaces?, backgroundTiles?. String-based type system (no enum constraint). Categories: desks, chairs, storage, electronics, decor, wall, misc. Wall-placeable items (`canPlaceOnWalls: true`) use the `wall` category and appear in a dedicated "Wall" tab in the editor. Asset naming convention: `{BASE}[_{ORIENTATION}][_{STATE}]` (e.g., `MONITOR_FRONT_OFF`, `CRT_MONITOR_BACK`). `orientation` is stored on `FurnitureCatalogEntry` and used for chair z-sorting and seat facing direction.

**Rotation groups**: `buildDynamicCatalog()` builds `rotationGroups` Map from assets sharing a `groupId`. Flexible: supports 2+ orientations (e.g., front/back only). Editor palette shows 1 item per group (front orientation preferred). `getRotatedType()` cycles through available orientations.

**State groups**: Items with `state: "on"` / `"off"` sharing the same `groupId` + `orientation` form toggle pairs. `stateGroups` Map enables `getToggledType()` lookup. Editor palette hides on-state variants, showing only the off/default version. State groups are mirrored across orientations (on-state variants get their own rotation groups).

**Auto-state**: `officeState.rebuildFurnitureInstances()` swaps electronics to ON sprites when an active agent faces a desk with that item nearby (3 tiles deep in facing direction, 1 tile to each side). Operates at render time without modifying the saved layout.

**Background tiles**: `backgroundTiles?: number` on `FurnitureCatalogEntry` — top N footprint rows allow other furniture to be placed on them AND characters to walk through them. Items on background rows render behind the host furniture via z-sort (lower zY). Both `getBlockedTiles()` and `getPlacementBlockedTiles()` skip bg rows; `canPlaceFurniture()` also skips the new item's own bg rows (symmetric placement). Set via asset-manager.html "Background Tiles" field.

**Surface placement**: `canPlaceOnSurfaces?: boolean` on `FurnitureCatalogEntry` — items like laptops, monitors, mugs can overlap with all tiles of `isDesk` furniture. `canPlaceFurniture()` builds a desk-tile set and excludes it from collision checks for surface items. Z-sort fix: `layoutToFurnitureInstances()` pre-computes desk zY per tile; surface items get `zY = max(spriteBottom, deskZY + 0.5)` so they render in front of the desk. Set via asset-manager.html "Can Place On Surfaces" checkbox. Exported through `5-export-assets.ts` → `furniture-catalog.json`.

**Wall placement**: `canPlaceOnWalls?: boolean` on `FurnitureCatalogEntry` — items like paintings, windows, clocks can only be placed on wall tiles (and cannot be placed on floor). `canPlaceFurniture()` requires the bottom row of the footprint to be on wall tiles; upper rows may extend above the map (negative row). `getWallPlacementRow()` offsets placement so the bottom row aligns with the hovered tile. Items can have negative `row` values in `PlacedFurniture`. Set via asset-manager.html "Can Place On Walls" checkbox.

**Colorize module**: Shared `colorize.ts` with two modes selected by `FloorColor.colorize?` flag. **Colorize mode** (Photoshop-style): grayscale → luminance → contrast → brightness → fixed HSL; always used for floor tiles. **Adjust mode** (default for furniture and character hue shifts): shifts original pixel HSL — H rotates hue (±180), S shifts saturation (±100), B/C shift lightness/contrast. `adjustSprite()` exported for reuse (character hue shifts). Toolbar shows a "Colorize" checkbox to toggle modes. Generic `Map<string, SpriteData>` cache keyed by arbitrary string (includes colorize flag). `layoutToFurnitureInstances()` colorizes sprites when `PlacedFurniture.color` is set.

**Floor tiles**: `floors.png` (112×16, 7 patterns). Cached by (pattern, h, s, b, c). Migration: old layouts auto-mapped to new patterns.

**Wall tiles**: `walls.png` (64×128, 4×4 grid of 16×32 pieces). 4-bit auto-tile bitmask (N=1, E=2, S=4, W=8). Sprites extend 16px above tile (3D face). Loaded by extension → `wallTilesLoaded` message. `wallTiles.ts` computes bitmask at render time. Colorizable via HSBC sliders (Colorize mode, stored per-tile in `tileColors`). Wall sprites are z-sorted with furniture and characters (`getWallInstances()` builds `FurnitureInstance[]` with `zY = (row+1)*TILE_SIZE`); only the flat base color is rendered in the tile pass. `generate-walls.js` creates the PNG; `wall-tile-editor.html` for visual editing.

**Character sprites**: 6 pre-colored PNGs (`assets/characters/char_0.png`–`char_5.png`), one per palette. Each 112×96: 7 frames × 16px wide, 3 direction rows × 32px tall (24px sprite bottom-aligned with 8px top padding). Row 0 = down, Row 1 = up, Row 2 = right. Frame order: walk1, walk2, walk3, type1, type2, read1, read2. No dedicated idle frames — idle uses walk2 (standing pose). Left = flipped right at runtime. Generated by `scripts/export-characters.ts` which bakes `CHARACTER_PALETTES` colors into templates. Loaded by extension → `characterSpritesLoaded` message (array of 6 character sprite sets). `spriteData.ts` uses pre-colored data directly (no palette swapping); hardcoded template fallback when PNGs not loaded. When `hueShift !== 0`, `hueShiftSprites()` applies `adjustSprite()` (HSL hue rotation) to all frames before caching.

**Load order**: `characterSpritesLoaded` → `floorTilesLoaded` → `wallTilesLoaded` → `furnitureAssetsLoaded` (catalog built synchronously) → `layoutLoaded`.

## Condensed Lessons

- `fs.watch` unreliable on Windows — always pair with polling backup
- Partial line buffering essential for append-only file reads (carry unterminated lines)
- Delay `agentToolDone` 300ms to prevent React batching from hiding brief active states
- JSONL text-only assistant records are often intermediate (followed by tool_use). Reliable turn-end = `system` + `subtype: "turn_duration"`. Fallback: 2s debounce
- User prompt `content` can be string (text) or array (tool_results) — handle both
- `/clear` creates NEW JSONL file (old file just stops)
- `--output-format stream-json` needs non-TTY stdin — can't use with VS Code terminals
- Hook-based IPC failed (hooks captured at startup, env vars don't propagate). JSONL watching works
- PNG→SpriteData: pngjs for RGBA buffer, alpha threshold 128
- OfficeCanvas selection changes are imperative (`editorState.selectedFurnitureUid`); must call `onEditorSelectionChange()` to trigger React re-render for toolbar

## Build & Dev

```sh
npm install && cd webview-ui && npm install && cd .. && npm run build
```
Build: type-check → lint → esbuild (extension) → vite (webview). F5 for Extension Dev Host.

## TypeScript Constraints

- No `enum` (`erasableSyntaxOnly`) — use `as const` objects
- `import type` required for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`)
- `noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters`

## Key Patterns

- `crypto.randomUUID()` works in VS Code extension host
- Terminal `cwd` option sets working directory at creation
- `/add-dir <path>` grants session access to additional directory

## Windows-MCP (Desktop Automation)

- `uvx --python 3.13 windows-mcp` — Tools: Snapshot, Click, Type, Scroll, Move, Shortcut, App, Shell, Wait, Scrape
- Webview buttons show `(0,0)` in a11y tree — must use `Snapshot(use_vision=true)` for coordinates
- Snap both VS Code windows side-by-side on SAME screen before clicking in Extension Dev Host
- Reload extension via button on main VS Code window after building

## Key Decisions

- `WebviewViewProvider` (not `WebviewPanel`) — lives in panel area alongside terminal
- Inline esbuild problem matcher (no extra extension needed)
- Webview is separate Vite project with own `node_modules`/`tsconfig`
